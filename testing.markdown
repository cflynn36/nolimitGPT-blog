## Introduction

This is a simple testing plan for nolimitGPT. The goal is to make sure the app works correctly and is easy to use.

## App Functionality

nolimitGPT provides the following functionalities:

1. User authentication using Google Sign-In.
2. Chatbot feature that allows users to send messages and receive responses.
3. Credit system for purchasing chatbot responses and image generation.
4. Payment processing for subscription and credit purchases.
5. Image generation feature that creates images based on user input.
6. User account management that stores the user's details in MongoDB.

Each of these functionalities should be tested to ensure they work correctly and meet user expectations. Additionally, any edge cases or error scenarios should also be tested to identify potential issues.

## Test Objectives

The main objectives of testing nolimitGPT are:

1. Check if the app works correctly and doesn't have major issues.
2. Make sure the app does what it's supposed to do.
3. Test if the app is easy to use and understand.

## Testing Steps

Follow these steps to test nolimitGPT:

1. **Set up the app**: Ensure that you have the latest version of nolimitGPT installed on your computer and that it is running correctly.
2. **Go through each feature**: Use the app as a normal user would and test all the features, such as signing in with Google, using the chatbot feature, checking credits, subscribing to a plan, canceling a subscription, using the image generator, and signing out.
3. **Take notes**: Write down any issues or problems you find while testing the app, including any error messages or unexpected behavior. Be sure to note the steps you took to replicate the issue, including any inputs or actions that caused the problem.
4. **Report issues**: Once you have completed testing, report any issues you found to the app developers. Include a detailed description of the problem, along with any steps needed to reproduce the issue. If possible, include screenshots or video recordings to help illustrate the issue.

## Test Cases

The following is an expanded list of test cases that should be considered when testing nolimitGPT:

1. **Sign in with Google**: Test if the Google Sign-In feature works correctly and allows users to sign in with their Google account.
2. **Chatbot feature**: Test the chatbot feature to ensure that it correctly responds to user messages and provides accurate information.
3. **Credit system**: Test the credit system to ensure that credits are properly deducted when users send messages to the chatbot and when they generate images.
4. **Subscription plans**: Test subscription plans to ensure that they can be purchased correctly, and that users are charged the correct amount for their selected plan.
5. **Cancel subscription**: Test if the cancel subscription feature works correctly and that the user's subscription is appropriately canceled.
6. **Image generator feature**: Test the image generator feature to ensure that it correctly generates images based on user input.
7. **Payment processing**: Test the payment processing feature to ensure that payments are processed correctly for subscription and credit purchases. Use Stripe testing keys to simulate different payment scenarios.
8. **Edge cases**: Test edge cases, such as what happens when a user enters invalid input, or when they have insufficient credits for a chatbot response or image generation.
9.  **Performance testing**: Test the app's performance under different conditions, such as high traffic or slow network speeds.

By following these testing steps and considering the test cases, you can ensure that nolimitGPT is thoroughly tested and any issues are properly documented and addressed.
